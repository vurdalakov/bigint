# BigInt

An ASP.NET Core application that performs operations with arbitrarily big integers, with no 64 bit limitation that most online tools have.

It is written in C# and is based on the [System.Numerics.BigInteger](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.numerics.biginteger.aspx) class.
